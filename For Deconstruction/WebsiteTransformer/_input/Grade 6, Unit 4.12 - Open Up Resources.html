<p>For grade 6: tracing paper, graph paper, colored pencils, scissors, and an index card to use as a straightedge or to mark right angles.</p>

<p>For grades 7 and 8: everything in grade 6, plus a ruler and protractor. Clear protractors with no holes and with radial lines printed on them are recommended.</p>

<p>Notes: (1) "Tracing paper" is easiest to use when it's a smaller size. Commercially-available "patty paper" is 5 inches by 5 inches and ideal for this. If using larger sheets of tracing paper, consider cutting them down for student use. (2) When compasses are required, they are listed as a separate Required Material.</p>

</p>
<p>This is the first of four lessons in which students use multiplication and division of fractions to solve geometric problems. In this lesson, they encounter problems involving fractional lengths. They use their understanding of the two&amp; interpretations of division—“how many groups?” and “how much in each group?”—to solve problems that involve multiplicative comparison (MP7).</p>

<p>In these geometry-themed lessons, students work with a wider range of fractions and mixed numbers, which gives them opportunities to choose their methods and tools for problem solving.</p>

Number Talk
</a>
<div class="resource-info">
<h4 class="resource-title">Number Talk</h4>
<p>What: One problem is displayed at a time. Students are given a few minutes to quietly think and give a signal when they have an answer and a strategy. The teacher selects students to share different strategies for each problem, “Who thought about it a different way?” Their explanations are recorded for all to see. Students might be pressed to provide more details about why they decided to approach a problem a certain way. It may not be possible to share every possible strategy for the given limited time; the teacher may only gather two or three distinctive strategies per problem. Problems are purposefully chosen to elicit different approaches, often in a way that builds from one problem to the next.</p>

<p>Where: Warm-ups</p>

<p>Why: Number talks build computational fluency by encouraging students to think about the numbers in a computation problem and rely on what they know about structure, patterns, and properties of operations to mentally solve a problem. Dot images are similar to number talks, except the image used is an arrangement of dots that students might count in different ways. While participating in these activities, students need to be precise in their word choice and use of language (MP6).</p>

Think Pair Share

<div class="resource-info">
<h4 class="resource-title">Think Pair Share</h4>
<p>What: Students have quiet time to think about a problem and work on it individually, and then time to share their response or their progress with a partner. Once these partner conversations have taken place, some partnerships are selected to share their thoughts with the class.</p>

<p>Where: Classroom activities</p>

<p>Why: This is a teaching routine useful in many contexts whose purpose is to give all students enough time to think about a prompt and form a response before they are expected to try to verbalize their thinking. First they have an opportunity to share their thinking in a low-stakes way with one partner, so that when they share with the class they can feel calm and confident, as well as say something meaningful that might advance everyone’s understanding. Additionally, the teacher has an opportunity to eavesdrop on the partner conversations so that she can purposefully select students to share with the class.</p>

<ol>
	<li>38 paper clips.
	<ul>
		<li>One side of the paper is 20 inches long. $20\div1\frac34=11\frac37$, so Lin can fit 11 paper clips along the side with a gap of $\frac34$ inch since $11\boldcdot 1\frac34 = 19\frac14$. If the paper clips are centered along the 20-inch length, there will be $\frac38$ inch of gap on either side.</li>
		<li>The other side is 14 inches long. $14\div1\frac34=8$, so Lin can fit 8 paper clips along the side with no gap at all.</li>
		<li>At each corner of the paper, two paper clips will meet. If the paper clip has a width that is about $\frac38$ inch (to fit in the $\frac38$ gap left by the 11 paper clips along the longer side), then there will be no gap or overlap.</li>
		<li>Altogether, Lin will need 38 paper clips. $11+11+8+8=38$</li>

	<li>34 paper clips. If space is put between the paper clips, then fewer paper clips will be needed. If a gap of $\frac14$ inch is between the paper clips, then each paper clip could have $\frac18$ inch of space on either end so that the paper clip and its space takes up 2 inches. Then there are 7 paper clips along the sides of length 14 inches of the frame, and there are 10 paper clips along the sides of length 20 inches.

<p>In this activity, students practice performing division of fractions and using it to solve multiplicative comparison problems. The activity extends the work students have done earlier in the unit. In the Fractions of Ropes activity (in Lesson 7), students use diagrams to reason about how many times as long one rope is compared to another. Having had more experience in interpreting division situations and having learned a division algorithm, students can solve a wider range of problems that involve a greater variety of fractions. Minimal scaffolding is given here, so students need to decide what representations or strategies would be fruitful.</p>

<p>Invite a couple of students to share their diagrams and equations. Ask the class whether they agree that the diagrams and equations represent the questions. Once students agree that the representations are appropriate, give them 8–10 minutes to complete the activity, either independently or collaboratively with their group.

<p>What: Students are shown some media or a mathematical representation. The prompt to students is “What do you notice? What do you wonder?” Students are given a few minutes to write down things they notice and things they wonder. After students have had a chance to write down their responses, the teacher asks several students to share things they noticed and things they wondered; these are recorded by the teacher for all to see. Usually, the teacher steers the conversation to wondering about something mathematical that the class is about to focus on.</p>

<p>Where: Appears frequently in warm-ups but also appears in launches to classroom activities.</p>

<p>Why: The purpose is to lower the bar for entry into a mathematical task for all students with these two low-stakes questions; by thinking about them and responding, students gain entry into the context and might get their curiosity piqued. Taking steps to become familiar with a context and the mathematics that might be involved is making sense of problems (MP1).

<p>Students might estimate the relationships between the lengths of rolls by rounding too much. For example, they might say that the length of the shorter roll is $\frac{1}{3}$ the length of the longer roll, or that the longer roll is twice as long as the shorter roll. If this happens, ask students to take a closer look and make a more precise estimate. Suggest that they divide the larger roll into smaller segments, each of which matches the length of the shorter rolls.</p>

</div>
<div class="content-section-header gray-text">Activity Synthesis</div>
<div class="content-section">
<p>Invite previously identified students to share their strategies for finding the length of the short roll. Display their diagram and record their reasoning for all to see.</p>

<p>To find the length of the short roll, some students may use $11 \frac 14 \div \frac 52 = ?$ and others $\frac 25 \boldcdot \frac{45}{4} = ?$, depending on how they view the relationship between the rolls. Highlight the idea that to find the length of the short roll, one way is to partition the length of the large roll into 5 equal pieces and find that length and multiply it by 2, because the length of the shorter roll is about $\frac25$ of that of the longer roll. This is an opportunity to reinforce the structure behind the division algorithm.</p>

<p>If appropriate, discuss the merits of writing the numbers as fractions versus as mixed numbers. Mixed numbers such as $2\frac12$ and $11\frac14$ are easier to visualize but $\frac52$ and $\frac{45}{4}$ are easier to work with. In fact, we have to use the fractions (rather than mixed numbers) to easily multiply. Explain that two forms serve different purposes and that it is helpful to be able to change from one to the other depending on what we aim to do. When writing them as solutions to problems, both forms are mathematically correct.</p>

<p>In this lesson, we used division to solve problems that involve fractional lengths. For example: How many $\frac58$-inch paper clips, laid end to end, are in a length of $12\frac12$ inches? Review how we can interpret such problems.</p>

<ul>
	<li>“How is this question like those we have seen? How can division help us answer it?” (It is a ‘how many groups?’ question. We can think of it as ‘how many $\frac58$s in $12\frac12$?’ and solve it by finding $12\frac12 \div \frac58$.)<br>
	 </li>
	<li>“Here is another question: ‘What is the length of one stick if 9 sticks, laid end to end, make $12\frac38$-inch?’ How does division help us answer it?” (It is a ‘how much in one group?’ question. We can answer it by finding $12\frac 38 \div 9$.)</li>
</ul>

<p>We also saw that division can help us compare two lengths and find out how many times one is as long as the other. For example, suppose one hiking trail, Trail A, is $1\frac18$ miles and another, Trail B, is $\frac34$ miles.</p>

<ul>
	<li>“How do we find out how many times as long as Trail A is Trail B?” (We can interpret the question as “___ times the length of A equals the length of B” or ${?} \boldcdot 1\frac18 = \frac34$, and then find $\frac34 \div 1\frac18$.)<br>
	 </li>
	<li>“What is another comparison question we could ask?” (How many times as long as Trail B is Trail A?)<br>
	 </li>
	<li>“How do we represent and answer that question?” (We can interpret it as “___ times the length of B is the length of A” or ${?} \boldcdot \frac34 = 1\frac18$, and then find $1\frac18 \div \frac34$.)</li>

Interpret and compute quotients of fractions, and solve word problems involving division of fractions by fractions, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations to represent the problem. <span class="clarification">For example, create a story context for $(2/3) \div (3/4)$ and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient; use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that $(2/3) \div (3/4) = 8/9$ because $3/4$ of $8/9$ is $2/3$. (In general, $(a/b) \div (c/d) = ad/bc$.) How much chocolate will each person get if 3 people share 1/2 lb of chocolate equally? How many 3/4-cup servings are in 2/3 of a cup of yogurt?

<p>A builder was building a fence. In the morning, he worked for $\frac25$ of an hour. In the afternoon, he worked for $\frac{9}{10}$ of an hour. How many times as long as in the morning did he work in the afternoon?</p>

<p>Write a division equation to represent this situation, then answer the question. Show your reasoning. If you get stuck, you can draw a diagram.</p>

<p>Division equation: $\frac {9}{10} \div \frac 25 = {?}$ (or $\frac {9}{10} \div {?} = \frac 25$). In the afternoon, he worked $2\frac14$ times as long as he did in the morning. Sample reasoning: $\frac {9}{10} \div \frac 25 = \frac {9}{10} \boldcdot \frac 52 = \frac {45}{20} = \frac94$.</p>
