<p>For grade 6: tracing paper, graph paper, colored pencils, scissors, and an index card to use as a straightedge or to mark right angles.</p>

<p>For grades 7 and 8: everything in grade 6, plus a ruler and protractor. Clear protractors with no holes and with radial lines printed on them are recommended.</p>

<p>Notes: (1) "Tracing paper" is easiest to use when it's a smaller size. Commercially-available "patty paper" is 5 inches by 5 inches and ideal for this. If using larger sheets of tracing paper, consider cutting them down for student use. (2) When compasses are required, they are listed as a separate Required Material.</p>

Think Pair Share

<div class="resource-info">
<h4 class="resource-title">Think Pair Share</h4>
<p>What: Students have quiet time to think about a problem and work on it individually, and then time to share their response or their progress with a partner. Once these partner conversations have taken place, some partnerships are selected to share their thoughts with the class.</p>

<p>Where: Classroom activities</p>

<p>Why: This is a teaching routine useful in many contexts whose purpose is to give all students enough time to think about a prompt and form a response before they are expected to try to verbalize their thinking. First they have an opportunity to share their thinking in a low-stakes way with one partner, so that when they share with the class they can feel calm and confident, as well as say something meaningful that might advance everyone’s understanding. Additionally, the teacher has an opportunity to eavesdrop on the partner conversations so that she can purposefully select students to share with the class.</p>

<p>This warm-up reinforces students’ understanding of what each of the four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) does when performed on fractions.

<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Display problems for all to see. Give students 1 minute of quiet think time.</p>

<p>Tell students not to calculate exact values of the expressions. Ask them to estimate the value of each expression by reasoning about the operation and the fractions, and then put the expressions in order based on their values, from least to greatest. Ask students to give a signal as soon as they have determined an order and can support it with an explanation.</p>

<div class="content-section">
<p>Some students may think the division expression would have the lowest value because they still assume that division always produces a number that is less than the dividend. This is not true for division by a positive number less than 1, which is the case here. If this misconception arises, consider addressing it during whole-class discussion.</p>

<h4 class="resource-title">Notice and Wonder</h4>
<p>What: Students are shown some media or a mathematical representation. The prompt to students is “What do you notice? What do you wonder?” Students are given a few minutes to write down things they notice and things they wonder. After students have had a chance to write down their responses, the teacher asks several students to share things they noticed and things they wondered; these are recorded by the teacher for all to see. Usually, the teacher steers the conversation to wondering about something mathematical that the class is about to focus on.</p>

<p>Where: Appears frequently in warm-ups but also appears in launches to classroom activities.</p>

<p>Why: The purpose is to lower the bar for entry into a mathematical task for all students with these two low-stakes questions; by thinking about them and responding, students gain entry into the context and might get their curiosity piqued. Taking steps to become familiar with a context and the mathematics that might be involved is making sense of problems (MP1).

<p>This activity prompts students to make sense of and write equations for a variety of situations involving fractions and all four operations. After writing equations, students are assigned two problems to solve, at least one of which is a division problem. Before calculating, students first estimate their answer. Doing so helps them to attend to the meaning of the operation and to the reasonableness of their calculated answer in the context of the situation.</p>

<p>Give students a minute to skim the two sets of problems. Ask them to be prepared to share at least one thing they notice and one thing they wonder. Then, invite a few students to share their observations and questions.</p>

<p>Keep students in groups of 2. Tell students they will practice writing equations to represent situations in context. Ask one person to write an equation for each question labeled with a letter and the number 1, and the other person to do the same for each question labeled with a letter and the number 2. Give groups 4–5 minutes to write their equations, and another 4–5 minutes to check each other’s equations and discuss any questions or issues.</p>

<p>Afterward, briefly discuss and compare the equations as a class. Point out equations that correctly represent the same problem (and are thus equivalent) but are expressed differently. For example, a student may write a multiplication equation with a missing factor, while another writes a division equation with an unknown quotient.</p>

<p>Next, assign at least 1 division problem and 1 problem involving another operation for each student (or group) to solve. Consider preparing the assignments, or an efficient way to assign the problems, in advance. Give students 4–5 minutes of quiet work time or collaboration time.</p>

<p>This optional activity gives students another opportunity to use what they have learned about all operations to model and solve a problem in a baking context. Students need to make sense of the problem and persevere in solving it (MP1).</p>

<p>Students may approach the problem in different ways (by drawing diagrams, making computations, reasoning verbally, etc.). Students may also choose different operations to obtain the information they need. For instance, instead of dividing by a fraction, they may perform repeated subtraction. Notice the different methods students use and identify strategies or explanations that should be shared with the class.</p>

<p>Mai, Kiran, and Clare are baking cookies together. They need $\frac 34$ cup of flour and $\frac 13$ cup of butter to make a batch of cookies. They each brought the ingredients they had at home.</p>

<div class="content-section">
<p>The students brought $4 \frac 14$ cups of flour and $1 \frac 12$ cups of butter. Flour: $2+1+1\frac 14=4 \frac 14$. Butter: $\frac 14 + \frac 12 +\frac 34=1\frac12$.</p>

<p>They have enough flour for $5 \frac 23$ batches, because $\left(4 \frac 14\right) \div \frac 34 = \frac{17}{4} \boldcdot \frac43 = \frac{17}{3} = 5 \frac 23$.</p>

<p>They have enough butter for $4 \frac 12$ batches, because $\left(1 \frac 12\right)\div \frac 13=\frac 32 \boldcdot \frac31= \frac 92 =4 \frac 12$. Given the amount of butter, they can make 4 whole batches of cookies.</p>

<p>Consider combining every 2–3 groups of 2 students and having students discuss their responses and methods in larger groups of 4–6.</p>

<p>If time permits, reconvene as a class to highlight a couple of strategies and reflect on the effectiveness and efficiency of students’ strategies. For example, if some students performed repeated addition instead of multiplying (or repeated subtraction instead of dividing), ask if repeated addition (or subtraction) is always as efficient as multiplication (or division), or under what circumstances one method might be preferred over the other.</p>

<p>This lesson gave students opportunities to use operations to solve a variety of contextual problems that involve fractions. Review the operations with students and help them reflect on their problem-solving process. Ask questions such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>“How did you add or subtract fractions with different denominators?”</li>
	<li>“How did you multiply fractions?”</li>
	<li>“What method(s) did you use to divide a number by a fraction?”</li>
