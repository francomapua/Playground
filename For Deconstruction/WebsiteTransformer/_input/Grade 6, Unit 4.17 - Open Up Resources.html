<p>Notes: (1) "Tracing paper" is easiest to use when it's a smaller size. Commercially-available "patty paper" is 5 inches by 5 inches and ideal for this.

<p>In this three-part culminating activity, students use what they have learned to determine the most economical way to ship jewelry boxes using the United States Postal Service (USPS) flat-rate options.</p>

<p>In Part 1, students make sense of the task, outline what they will need to know and do to answer the question, and map out their plan. In Part 2, they model the problem, calculate the number of jewelry boxes that will fit into each shipping box, and determine the associated costs. Students experiment with different orientations for the jewelry boxes to optimize space and minimize cost. In Part 3, they present, reflect, and discuss. Students explain their strategies and reasoning (MP3) and evaluate the decisions about how to fit all 270 jewelry boxes so they ship at the lowest cost (MP4). As a class, students reflect on how the orientation of the jewelry boxes and the size of the shipping boxes affected the unit cost for shipping each box of jewelry.</p>

<p>Depending on the instructional choices made, this lesson could take one or more class meetings. The time estimates are intentionally left blank because the amount of time needed might vary depending on factors such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If students will research the flat-rate options themselves, or be provided with this information.</li>
	<li>If each group will explore all size options or only one option.</li>
	<li>How much organizational support is given to students.</li>
	<li>How student work is ultimately shared with the class (e.g., not at all, informally, or with formal presentations).</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider defining the scope of work further and setting a time limit for each part of the activity to focus students’ work and optimize class time.</p>

<p>In this first part of the project, students make sense of the task at hand and determine what they need to know and do to find the most economical shipping box combination. Students should recognize that they will need to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Find out the measurements of the jewelry boxes and shipping boxes, as well as the costs for mailing a shipping box of each size. Asking students to find out this information themselves will increase the modeling demand (MP4).</li>
	<li>Decide on an orientation for the jewelry boxes inside each shipping box and calculate how many jewelry boxes will fit with that particular orientation.</li>
	<li>Test out different orientations and how they affect the number of jewelry boxes to be fitted and the cost.</li>
</ul>

<p>Students may want to think of a strategy for considering different configurations efficiently, rather than testing all of them, which would be time consuming and repetitive. As students make plans to try out different jewelry box orientations and associated calculations, encourage them to work systematically to minimize omissions and errors. Urge students to create drawings or models of the boxes to show the calculations they will need to make.</p>

<p>Consider supporting students by discussing the different orientations of jewelry boxes in a shipping box (Which orientations are possible? How much empty space would result?) and possible ways to use drawings or diagrams to show the arrangements of jewelry boxes.</p>

To provide a structured and interactive opportunity for students to revise and refine both their ideas and their verbal and written output. This routine provides a purpose for student conversation as well as fortifies output. The main idea is to have students think or write individually about a response, use a structured pairing strategy to have multiple opportunities to refine and clarify the response through conversation, and then finally revise their original written response. Throughout this process, students should be pressed for details, and encouraged to press each other for details.

This routine supports meta-cognitive and meta-linguistic awareness, and also supports mathematical conversation.

<p>Work with your group to find the best plan for shipping the boxes of necklaces. Each member of your group should select a different type of flat-rate shipping box and answer the following questions. Recall that each jewelry box is $1\frac34$ inches by $2\frac14$ inches by $\frac34$ inch, and that there are 270 jewelry boxes to be shipped.</p>

<p>For each type of flat-rate shipping box:</p>

	<p>Answers vary. Students should decide how they want to orient the jewelry boxes inside the mailing boxes. Then they can compute how many boxes will fit into the mailing box with that particular orientation. Often there will be a gap left where additional jewelry boxes will fit. Each mailing box allows for several different orientations.</p>

	<p>Small box: The jewelry box has dimension $\frac74\times\frac94\times\frac34$ or $\frac{14}{8}\times\frac{18}{8}\times\frac{6}{8}$ and the small shipping box has dimension $\frac{43}{8}\times\frac{69}{8}\times\frac{13}{8}$. At most 18 (3 by 3 by 2) jewelry boxes can fit into the shipping box (other orientations would lead to fewer boxes). </p>

	<p>Medium box 1: Different orientations and results are possible. If the jewelry box is oriented with the $\frac34$ inch side as the height and lining up the $1\frac34$-inch side along the 11-inch side of the mailing box, then we can fit $6\boldcdot 3\boldcdot 7=126$ boxes. This will leave a gap in the back of the box where we can fit an additional $1\boldcdot 3\boldcdot 7=21$ boxes for a total of 147 boxes.</p>

	<p>Medium box 2: Different orientations and results are possible. If the jewelry box is oriented with the $\frac34$-inch side as the height and lining up the $2\frac14$-inch side along the $13\frac58$-inch side of the mailing box, then we can fit $6\boldcdot 6\boldcdot 4=144$ boxes. This will leave a gap in the back of the box where we can fit an additional $1\boldcdot 1\boldcdot 7=7$ boxes for a total of 151 boxes.</p>

	<p>Large box: Different orientations should be considered. Orientation 1: If the jewelry box is oriented with the $\frac34$-inch side as the height, then we can fit 234 boxes: $5 \boldcdot 6 \boldcdot 7=210$ oriented one way, and an additional $6\boldcdot 2\boldcdot 2=24$ oriented differently, squeezed in the gap left by the first set of boxes. Orientation 2: If the jewelry box is oriented with the $1\frac34$-inch side as the height, then we can fit 252 boxes: $16 \boldcdot 5\boldcdot 3=240$ oriented one way, and an additional $6\boldcdot 1\boldcdot 2=12$ oriented differently, squeezed in the gap left by the first set of boxes.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<ul>
		<li>Small box: We would need 15 small boxes, for a total cost of $102.</li>
		<li>Medium boxes: We would need 2 medium boxes of either type, for a total cost of $26.90.</li>
		<li>Large box: We would need 2 large boxes, for a total cost of $37.50.</li>

To capture students’ oral words and phrases into a stable, collective reference. The intent of this routine is to stabilize the fleeting language that students use during partner, small-group, or whole-class activities in order for student’s own output to be used as a reference in developing their mathematical language. The teacher listens for, and scribes, the student output using written words, diagrams and pictures; this collected output can be organized, revoiced, or explicitly connected to other language in a display for all students to use. This routine provides feedback for students in a way that increases accessibility while simultaneously supporting meta-awareness of language.
