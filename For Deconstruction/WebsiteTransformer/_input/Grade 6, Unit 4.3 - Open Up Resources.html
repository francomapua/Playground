<p>In an earlier lesson, students were reminded of the connection between multiplication and division. They revisited the idea of division as a way to find a missing factor, which can either be the number of groups, or the size of one group. </p>

<p>In this lesson, students interpret division situations in story problems that involve equal-size groups. They draw diagrams and write division and multiplication equations to make sense of the relationship between known and unknown quantities (MP2).</p>

<p>In this warm-up, students determine the number of dots in an image without counting and explain how they arrived at that answer. The goal is to prompt them to visualize and articulate different ways to decompose the dots, using what they know about arrays, multiplication, and area to arrive at the total number. To discourage counting and encourage students to focus on the structure of the dots, the image will be flashed and hidden a couple of times, rather than displayed the entire time.</p>

<div class="content-section" id="classroom_activity_1_activity-long-launch">
<p>Tell students to keep their materials closed. Explain that you will show an image that contains dots for 3 seconds. Their job is to determine how many dots there are and explain how they saw them.</p>

<p>Display the image for 3 seconds and then hide it. Do this twice. Give students up to 1 minute of quiet think time after each flash. Encourage students who have one way of seeing the dots to think about another way while they wait.</p>

<div class="swd-annotation">
<em>Memory: Processing Time. </em>This instructional routine can be very taxing to student's working memory. For students with challenges in this area, show the image for a longer period of time or repeat the image flash as needed. Students also benefit from being explicitly told not to count the dots, but instead to look for helpful structure within the image.</div>

<p>Select a couple of students to share the number of dots they saw.

<p>What: Fans of <em>5 Practices for Orchestrating Productive Mathematical Discussions</em> (Smith and Stein, 2011) will recognize these as the 5 Practices. In this curriculum, much of the work of anticipating, sequencing, and connecting is handled by the materials in the activity narrative, launch, and synthesis sections. But teachers will need to take this ball and run with it by developing the capacity to prepare for and conduct whole-class discussions. The book itself would make excellent fodder for a teacher PLC or study group.</p>

<p>Where: Many classroom activities lend themselves to this structure.</p>

<p>Why: In a problem-based curriculum, many activities can be described as “do math and talk about it,” but the 5 Practices lend more structure to these activities so that they more reliably result in students making connections and learning new mathematics.</p>

</a>
<div class="resource-info">
<h4 class="resource-title">Notice and Wonder</h4>
<p>What: Students are shown some media or a mathematical representation. The prompt to students is “What do you notice? What do you wonder?” Students are given a few minutes to write down things they notice and things they wonder. After students have had a chance to write down their responses, the teacher asks several students to share things they noticed and things they wondered; these are recorded by the teacher for all to see. Usually, the teacher steers the conversation to wondering about something mathematical that the class is about to focus on.</p>

<p>Where: Appears frequently in warm-ups but also appears in launches to classroom activities.</p>

<p>Why: The purpose is to lower the bar for entry into a mathematical task for all students with these two low-stakes questions; by thinking about them and responding, students gain entry into the context and might get their curiosity piqued. Taking steps to become familiar with a context and the mathematics that might be involved is making sense of problems (MP1).

Interpret and compute quotients of fractions, and solve word problems involving division of fractions by fractions, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations to represent the problem. <span class="clarification">For example, create a story context for $(2/3) \div (3/4)$ and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient; use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that $(2/3) \div (3/4) = 8/9$ because $3/4$ of $8/9$ is $2/3$. (In general, $(a/b) \div (c/d) = ad/bc$.) How much chocolate will each person get if 3 people share 1/2 lb of chocolate equally? How many 3/4-cup servings are in 2/3 of a cup of yogurt?

<p>This activity allows students to draw diagrams and write equations to represent simple division situations. Some students may draw concrete diagrams; others may draw abstract ones. Any diagrammatic representation is fine as long as it enables students to make sense of the relationship between the number of groups, the size of a group, and a total amount.</p>

<p>The last question is likely more challenging to represent with a diagram. Because the question asks for the number of jars, and because the amount per jar is a fraction, students will not initially know how many jars to draw (unless they know what $6\frac34 \div \frac34$ is). Suggest that they start with an estimate, and as they reason about the problem, add jars to (or remove jars from) their diagram as needed. </p>

<p>As students work, monitor for the range of diagrams that students create. Select a few students whose work represent the range of diagrams to share later.</p>

<p>Students in digital classrooms can use an applet to make sense of the problems, but it is still preferable that they create their own diagrams. </p>

<div class="content-section-header gray-text">Launch</div>
<div class="content-section" id="classroom_activity_2_activity-long-launch">
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Tell the class that you will read the three story problems, and ask them to be prepared to share at least one thing they notice and one thing they wonder. After reading, give them a minute to share their observation and question with their partner.</p>

<p>Clarify that their job is to draw a diagram and write a multiplication equation to express the relationship in each story and then answer the question. Give students 7–8 minutes of quiet work time, followed by 2–3 minutes to share their work with their partner.</p>

<p>If the applet is used to complete the activity or for class discussion, note that the toolbar includes colored rectangles that represent fractional parts. Encourage students to drop the fractional parts in the work space on the left of the window, and then use the Move tool (the arrow) to drag them into the jars. The blocks do snap, but the grid is very fine so this may be challenging for some students. Troubleshooting tip: if two blocks get stuck together, delete them. Try not to overlap blocks when adding them to the work space.</p>

<div class="resource-info">
<h4 class="resource-title">Think Pair Share</h4>
<p>What: Students have quiet time to think about a problem and work on it individually, and then time to share their response or their progress with a partner. Once these partner conversations have taken place, some partnerships are selected to share their thoughts with the class.</p>

<p>Where: Classroom activities</p>

<p>Why: This is a teaching routine useful in many contexts whose purpose is to give all students enough time to think about a prompt and form a response before they are expected to try to verbalize their thinking. First they have an opportunity to share their thinking in a low-stakes way with one partner, so that when they share with the class they can feel calm and confident, as well as say something meaningful that might advance everyone’s understanding. Additionally, the teacher has an opportunity to eavesdrop on the partner conversations so that she can purposefully select students to share with the class.</p>

To capture students’ oral words and phrases into a stable, collective reference. The intent of this routine is to stabilize the fleeting language that students use during partner, small-group, or whole-class activities in order for student’s own output to be used as a reference in developing their mathematical language. The teacher listens for, and scribes, the student output using written words, diagrams and pictures; this collected output can be organized, revoiced, or explicitly connected to other language in a display for all students to use. This routine provides feedback for students in a way that increases accessibility while simultaneously supporting meta-awareness of language.

Interpret and compute quotients of fractions, and solve word problems involving division of fractions by fractions, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations to represent the problem. <span class="clarification">For example, create a story context for $(2/3) \div (3/4)$ and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient; use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that $(2/3) \div (3/4) = 8/9$ because $3/4$ of $8/9$ is $2/3$. (In general, $(a/b) \div (c/d) = ad/bc$.) How much chocolate will each person get if 3 people share 1/2 lb of chocolate equally? How many 3/4-cup servings are in 2/3 of a cup of yogurt? How wide is a rectangular strip of land with length 3/4 mi and area 1/2 square mi? </span>

		<li>$6 \boldcdot {?} = 27$ or $27 \div 6 = {?}$</li>
		<li>$4\frac12$ ounces. Reasoning varies. Sample reasoning:
		<ul>
			<li>3 groups of 9 make 27. Splitting each of the 3 groups into 2 gives us 6 groups. Each group is half of 9, which is $4\frac 12$.</li>
			<li>27 divided by 6 is 4 with a remainder of 3. That means 27 is made of 6 groups of size 4 and a remainder of 3. Splitting the remainder of 3 into 6 groups makes 6 groups of size $\frac12$. That means that 27 is made of 6 groups of size $4\frac12$.</li>
