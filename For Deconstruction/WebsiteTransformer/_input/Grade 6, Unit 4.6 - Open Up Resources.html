<p>For grade 6: tracing paper, graph paper, colored pencils, scissors, and an index card to use as a straightedge or to mark right angles.</p>

<p>For grades 7 and 8: everything in grade 6, plus a ruler and protractor. Clear protractors with no holes and with radial lines printed on them are recommended.</p>

<p>Notes: (1) "Tracing paper" is easiest to use when it's a smaller size. Commercially-available "patty paper" is 5 inches by 5 inches and ideal for this. If using larger sheets of tracing paper, consider cutting them down for student use. (2) When compasses are required, they are listed as a separate Required Material.</p>

</p>
<p>This is the second lesson in a series of three lessons exploring the “how many groups?” interpretation of division in situations involving fractions.<br>
In the preceding lesson and in this one, the number of groups in each given situation is 1 or greater. In the next lesson, students find the number of groups that is less than 1 (“what fraction of a group?”).</p>

<p>Students have used different diagrams to represent multiplication and division. In this lesson, tape diagrams are spotlighted and used more explicitly. They are more abstract and more flexible than other representations students may have chosen for thinking about division problems that involve fractions. Because they use measurement along the length of the tape, tape diagrams are closer to the number line representation of fractions, and ultimately help students visualize division problems on the number line. (Students are not required to do that in this lesson, however.)</p>

<p>Students continue to make the journey from reasoning with concrete quantities to reasoning with abstract representations of fraction<br>
division (MP2).</p>

Think Pair Share

<div class="resource-info">
<h4 class="resource-title">Think Pair Share</h4>
<p>What: Students have quiet time to think about a problem and work on it individually, and then time to share their response or their progress with a partner. Once these partner conversations have taken place, some partnerships are selected to share their thoughts with the class.</p>

<p>Where: Classroom activities</p>

<p>Why: This is a teaching routine useful in many contexts whose purpose is to give all students enough time to think about a prompt and form a response before they are expected to try to verbalize their thinking. First they have an opportunity to share their thinking in a low-stakes way with one partner, so that when they share with the class they can feel calm and confident, as well as say something meaningful that might advance everyone’s understanding. Additionally, the teacher has an opportunity to eavesdrop on the partner conversations so that she can purposefully select students to share with the class.</p>

	(In the first question, the length of the tape represents 10, and there are 10 grid squares, so each grid represents 1. Since the size of each group is $2\frac12$, each part needs to have $2\frac12$ squares.)</li>
	<li>“In the second question, we see three groups of 2 and an extra square of 1. How did you know that the 1 is $\frac12$ of a group and not $\frac17$ of a group?” (The question asks “how many groups of 2 . . .,” so the size of each group is 2, not 7.)</li>

To provide a structured and interactive opportunity for students to revise and refine both their ideas and their verbal and written output. This routine provides a purpose for student conversation as well as fortifies output. The main idea is to have students think or write individually about a response, use a structured pairing strategy to have multiple opportunities to refine and clarify the response through conversation, and then finally revise their original written response. Throughout this process, students should be pressed for details, and encouraged to press each other for details.

To capture students’ oral words and phrases into a stable, collective reference. The intent of this routine is to stabilize the fleeting language that students use during partner, small-group, or whole-class activities in order for student’s own output to be used as a reference in developing their mathematical language. The teacher listens for, and scribes, the student output using written words, diagrams and pictures; this collected output can be organized, revoiced, or explicitly connected to other language in a display for all students to use. This routine provides feedback for students in a way that increases accessibility while simultaneously supporting meta-awareness of language.

<p>In this lesson, students transition away from using concrete tools (pattern blocks and fraction strips) for reasoning about division to using a tool that is more abstract and more flexible. To represent “how many groups?” or “how many of this in that?” questions, they draw tape diagrams on a grid.</p>

<p>Students continue to write multiplication and division equations to make sense of given situations, but here, they also think about the reasonableness of their answers. They see that the solution to a division problem can be checked using the corresponding multiplication equation.</p>

<p>Some students may write answers as fractions and others as mixed numbers. Both are acceptable. Depending on the situation, one may be more useful than the other. For example, in a measurement situation, a mixed number is easier to interpret, but if we need to perform further calculations with an answer, a fraction is easier to work with. In the course of the unit, students should become comfortable with both forms and be flexible in using them.</p>

	<li>Answers vary. Sample reasoning: The tape diagram shows 1 whole broken into 3 equal parts. Each part is $\frac 13$, so two parts make $\frac 23$. There is one group of size $\frac 23$, plus an extra $\frac 13$, which is half of a group of the same size. This means there are $1\frac12$ groups of size $\frac 23$ in 1, or $1 \div \frac 23= 1\frac12$.

<p>Students may misinterpret the given diagram and think that the answer can only be a whole number because in the diagram, “1 group” is shaded, but the fraction of a group is not. Remind students of their work with pattern blocks in which we saw that the answer to the question “how many of this in that?” or “how many rhombuses are in a trapezoid” could involve a whole number and a fraction.</p>

</div>
<div class="content-section-header gray-text">Activity Synthesis</div>
<div class="content-section">
<p>Focus the whole-class discussion on two goals: reflecting on the process of creating and using the diagrams, and discussing how we can check our solutions.</p>

<p>For each problem in the second question, select a student to share their response and ask how many others had the same diagram.<br>
If students’ diagrams cannot be easily displayed for all to see, consider showing the ones in the Possible Responses. To help students reflect on their process, discuss:</p>

<ul>
	<li>“How did you begin the diagram? How did you know how to partition the pieces in the diagram?”</li>
	<li>“Which of the two equations—multiplication or division—was helpful in setting up the diagram? How so?”</li>
	<li>“How did you determine how many groups there are?”</li>
	<li>“Can we use pattern blocks to represent these situations? Which might be preferable and why?”</li>
</ul>

<p>Reinforce the idea that the size of 1 group is what we use as the unit for counting and to find out how many groups there are.</p>

<p>To prompt students to think about the reasonableness of their answers, ask: “How would you know if your answer is correct?” If not mentioned by students, point out how to use multiplication to check their solution to the division problem. For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>We wrote ${?} \boldcdot \frac 23 = 1$ to represent “how many $\frac 23$ are in 1?”.</li>
	<li>We found the answer to be $1\frac12$, so we can substitute $1\frac12$ for the “?” and see if $1\frac12 \boldcdot \frac23$ is indeed 1.</li>
	<li>$1\frac12 = \frac 32$, so we can rewrite that expression as $\frac 32 \boldcdot \frac 23$.</li>
	<li>$\frac 32 \boldcdot \frac 23 = 1$, so the answer is correct.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this activity, students use diagrams and equations to solve division problems in context. Though tape diagrams are not required, students may find them to be a handy option.</p>

<p>The task prompts students to draw diagrams before asking them to write equations. Some students may find it easier to make sense of the problems by going the other way around (i.e., writing equations first). Either way of reasoning is fine.</p>

<p>Students may also choose to express each whole-number or mixed-number dividend as a fraction. For example, they may express the 6 inches as $\frac{48}{8}$ inches and then see how many $\frac38$s are in $\frac{48}{8}$. As students work, notice the different strategies they use.</p>

<ul>

	<p>“In the question ‘how many $\frac34$s are in 6?’ (or $6 \div \frac34 = {?}$), what does each number represent?” ($\frac34$ represents the size of each group. 6 is the total amount.)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>“What would a tape diagram for this situation show?” (A total tape length representing 6, broken into parts of $\frac34$ each.)</p>

	<li>
	<p>“What if that length cannot be broken equally into $\frac34$s? How do we deal with the remainder?” (We can think of it as a partial group. We can compare it to the size of 1 group and see what fraction of a group it is.)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>“We have used pattern blocks, fraction strips, and other diagrams to help us think about division with fractions. How are tape diagrams and these other tools alike?” (They all allow us to represent equal-sized groups so we can see the relationships between the numbers.)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>“How are tape diagrams different than those tools for reasoning about, say, $6 \div \frac34$ or $18 \div \frac 25$?” (Tape diagrams may be more practical since we can specify what the length of the tape and what each part represent. If we use pattern blocks, we may need a lot of blocks to represent certain numbers. If we use fraction strips, we may need to draw much longer strips. Also, not all fractions are shown on the strips, so we may need to add them.)</p>
