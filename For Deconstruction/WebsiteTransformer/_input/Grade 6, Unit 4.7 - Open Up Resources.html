<p>For grade 6: tracing paper, graph paper, colored pencils, scissors, and an index card to use as a straightedge or to mark right angles.</p>

<p>For grades 7 and 8: everything in grade 6, plus a ruler and protractor. Clear protractors with no holes and with radial lines printed on them are recommended.</p>

<p>Notes: (1) "Tracing paper" is easiest to use when it's a smaller size. Commercially-available "patty paper" is 5 inches by 5 inches and ideal for this. If using larger sheets of tracing paper, consider cutting them down for student use. (2) When compasses are required, they are listed as a separate Required Material.</p>

</p>
<p>In the previous three lessons, students explored the “how many groups?” interpretation of division. Their explorations included situations where the number of groups was a whole number or a mixed number. In this lesson, they extend the work to include cases where the number of groups is a fraction less than 1, that is, situations in which the total amount is smaller than the size of 1 group. In such situations, the question becomes “what fraction of a group?”.</p>

<p>Students notice that they can use the same reasoning strategies as in situations with a whole number of groups, because the structure $$\text{(number of groups)} \boldcdot \text{(size of a group)} = \text{(total amount)}$$ is the same as before (MP7). They write multiplication equations of this form and for the corresponding division equations.</p>

<p>Throughout the lesson, students practice attending to details (in diagrams, descriptions, or equations) about how the given quantities relate to the size of 1 group.</p>

<p>In this warm-up, students estimate the value of a fraction of a number (e.g., $\frac13$ of 7) using what they know about the size of the given fraction. Then, they write multiplication expressions to represent the verbal questions. The goal is to activate prior understandings that a fraction of a number can be found by multiplication, preparing students to explore division problems in which the quotient is less than 1 whole.</p>

<p>Ask students to keep their materials closed. Display one estimation question at a time. (If all questions are displayed, ask students to work on one question at a time and to begin when cued.) Give students 30 seconds of quiet think time per question and ask them to give a signal when they have an answer and can explain their strategy.</p>

<p>Select 1–2 students to briefly share their estimates and how they made them. Record and display their estimates for all to see. After discussing the third estimation question, ask students to write a multiplication expression to represent each of the three questions.</p>

<h4 class="resource-title">Think Pair Share</h4>
<p>What: Students have quiet time to think about a problem and work on it individually, and then time to share their response or their progress with a partner. Once these partner conversations have taken place, some partnerships are selected to share their thoughts with the class.</p>

<p>Where: Classroom activities</p>

<p>Why: This is a teaching routine useful in many contexts whose purpose is to give all students enough time to think about a prompt and form a response before they are expected to try to verbalize their thinking. First they have an opportunity to share their thinking in a low-stakes way with one partner, so that when they share with the class they can feel calm and confident, as well as say something meaningful that might advance everyone’s understanding. Additionally, the teacher has an opportunity to eavesdrop on the partner conversations so that she can purposefully select students to share with the class.</p>

<p>This task helps to transition students from thinking about “how many groups?” to “what fraction of a group?”.</p>

<p>Students compare different lengths of ropes and express their relative lengths in multiplicative terms. Rope B and C are 5 and $2\frac12$ times as long as rope A, respectively, but rope D is shorter than rope A, so then we say that it is $\frac34$ times as long as rope A. They see that it is possible that the answer to a “how many groups?” question is a number less than 1 when the given amount is smaller than the size of a group.</p>

<p>As students work, notice how they go about making multiplicative comparisons. Select students who write clear and concise questions for the equations in the last problem so they can share later.</p>

<div class="content-section-header gray-text">Anticipated Misconceptions</div>
<div class="content-section">
<p>Some students might associate the wrong lengths with the ropes or confuse the order of comparison (e.g., comparing A to C instead of C to A). Encourage them to put the length of each rope next to the diagram and attend more closely to the ropes being compared.</p>

</div>
<div class="content-section-header gray-text">Activity Synthesis</div>
<div class="content-section">
<p>Display the solutions to the first set of problems for all to see. Give students a minute to check their answers and ask questions. Then, focus class discussion on two key ideas:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The connection between “how many groups?” questions and “how many times as long?” questions. Ask students how these two types of questions are similar and different. Make sure students see that both have the structure of $? \boldcdot a =b$, where $a$ is the size of 1 group (or the unit we are using for comparison), and $b$ is a given number. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The language commonly used when referring to a situation in which the number of groups is less than 1 whole. Explain that we have seen equal-sized groups where the number of groups is greater than 1, but some situations involve a part of 1 group. So instead of saying “the number of groups” or asking “how many groups?,” we would ask “what fraction of a group?” or “what part of a group?”. For example, in the case of rope D, where the answer is less than 1, we can ask, “What fraction of rope A is rope D?”</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Ask 1–2 previously identified students to share the question they wrote for the last pair of equations ($? \boldcdot 9=3$ and $3 \div 9= ?$). Make sure students see that this pair of equations represent a situation with a fractional group<br>
(i.e., rope D is shorter than rope C, so the length of rope D is a fraction of that of rope C).</p>

<p>Give students 2–3 minutes to discuss their responses with their partner. Follow with a whole-class discussion before students return to the last set of questions. </p>

<p>To help students see the structure in the diagrams, ask: “How are the diagrams for Monday and Tuesday like and unlike those for Thursday and Friday?” If not brought up in their responses, point out that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The size of 1 group (or the amount of milk in 1 batch) is the same in all diagrams, but the amounts we are comparing to 1 group vary. Those amounts are greater than 1 batch (9 cups) on Monday and Tuesday, and less than 1 batch on Thursday and Friday.</li>
	<li>This comparison to the size of 1 group is also reflected in the questions. We ask “how many batches?” for the first two, and “what fraction of a batch?” for the other two.</li>
</ul>

<p>To help students notice the structure in the equations, ask: “How are the division equations for Monday and Tuesday different than those for Thursday and Friday? How are they the same?”</p>

<p>$$12 \div 9 = ?$$</p>

<p>$$22 \frac 12 \div 9 = ?$$</p>

<p>$$6 \div 9 = ?$$</p>

<p>$$7 \frac 12 \div 9 = ?$$</p>

<p>Highlight that, regardless of whether the answer is greater than 1 or less than 1, the equations show that the questions “how many batches (of 9 cups)?” and “what fraction of a batch (of 9 cups)?” can be expressed with a division by 9, because the multiplication counterparts of these situations all have the structure of “what number times 9 equals a given amount of milk?” or $${?} \boldcdot 9 = b$$ where $b$ is a given amount of milk.</p>

<p>If students are not sure how to begin representing a situation with a tape diagram, ask them to represent one quantity or number at a time. For example, they could begin by showing the amount of milk used as a tape with a particular length, and then mark the second quantity (the amount of milk in 1 batch) on the same tape and with the same starting point. Or they could represent the amounts in the opposite order.</p>

<p>After students worked on the last set of problems, discuss the question “what fraction of 5 is $\frac12$?” To help students connect this question to previous ones, consider asking:</p>

<ul>
	<li>“How can we tell if the answer is greater than 1 or less than 1 before calculating?” (The phrase “what fraction of” offers a clue that it is less than 1. Or, we are comparing $\frac 12$ to 5 and can see that $\frac 12$ is less than 5.)</li>
	<li>“What is the size of 1 group here? How do we know?” (We can tell that 5 is the size of 1 group because that is the value to which another number is being compared.)</li>
	<li>“How do we write a multiplication equation for this question? A division equation?” (${?} \boldcdot 5 = \frac 12$, and $\frac 12\div 5 = {?}$)</li>
</ul>

<p>Select a student to display a correct diagram for the problem, or display this diagram for all to see. Discuss how the two given values and the solution are represented in the diagram.</p>

<p>In this lesson, we saw that a division problem can represent the idea of equal-sized groups but may have a total amount that is less than the size of one full group. Instead of “how many of this is in that?”, the question is now “what fraction of this is that?”.</p>

<ul>
	<li>“How can we tell if a division situation involves less than one whole group?” (The total amount is less than the size of the a group, or the question asks “what fraction of. . .?”)</li>
	<li>“How do we find quotients that are less than 1?” (We can write a multiplication equation that corresponds to the situation and draw a tape diagram to help us reason about what fraction of 1 group the given amount is.)</li>
</ul>

<p>We also explored division problems as representing the answers to comparison questions about measurement. Instead of “how many groups?”, we can ask “how many times as long (or as heavy)?” For example: $16 \div 4 = \,?$ corresponds to $? \boldcdot 4 = 16$, which can represent the question “how many times as long as 4 cm is 16 cm?” We can reason that 16 cm is 4 times as long as 4 cm.</p>

<p>In the same context, $3 \div 4$ corresponds to $? \boldcdot 4 = 3$, and would mean “how many times as long as 4 cm is 3 cm?” Here, we can see that the answer will be a fraction less than 1. Because 3 is $\frac34$ of 4, we can say “3 cm is $\frac34$ as long as 4 cm.”</p>

Interpret and compute quotients of fractions, and solve word problems involving division of fractions by fractions, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations to represent the problem. <span class="clarification">For example, create a story context for $(2/3) \div (3/4)$ and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient; use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that $(2/3) \div (3/4) = 8/9$ because $3/4$ of $8/9$ is $2/3$. (In general, $(a/b) \div (c/d) = ad/bc$.) How much chocolate will each person get if 3 people share 1/2 lb of chocolate equally? How many 3/4-cup servings are in 2/3 of a cup of yogurt?
