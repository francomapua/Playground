<p>For grade 6: tracing paper, graph paper, colored pencils, scissors, and an index card to use as a straightedge or to mark right angles.</p>

<p>For grades 7 and 8: everything in grade 6, plus a ruler and protractor. Clear protractors with no holes and with radial lines printed on them are recommended.</p>

<p>Notes: (1) "Tracing paper" is easiest to use when it's a smaller size. Commercially-available "patty paper" is 5 inches by 5 inches and ideal for this. If using larger sheets of tracing paper, consider cutting them down for student use. (2) When compasses are required, they are listed as a separate Required Material.</p>

</p>
<p>This lesson allows students to practice finding the amount in one group, and to interpret, represent, and solve different kinds of division problems with less scaffolding. In one activity, students are not explicitly told whether the division situations involve finding the number of groups or finding the amount in each group. They decide on an interpretation that would enable them to solve a division problem. Students are also required to identify relevant information (from a video, a picture, or written statements) that would help them answer questions. </p>

<p>Because the tasks in this lesson are not scaffolded, students will need to make sense of the problems and persevere to solve them (MP1). As students move back and forth between the contexts and the abstract equations and diagrams that represent them, they reason abstractly and quantitatively (MP2).</p>

Number Talk
</a>
<div class="resource-info">
<h4 class="resource-title">Number Talk</h4>
<p>What: One problem is displayed at a time. Students are given a few minutes to quietly think and give a signal when they have an answer and a strategy. The teacher selects students to share different strategies for each problem, “Who thought about it a different way?” Their explanations are recorded for all to see. Students might be pressed to provide more details about why they decided to approach a problem a certain way. It may not be possible to share every possible strategy for the given limited time; the teacher may only gather two or three distinctive strategies per problem. Problems are purposefully chosen to elicit different approaches, often in a way that builds from one problem to the next.</p>

<p>Where: Warm-ups</p>

<p>Why: Number talks build computational fluency by encouraging students to think about the numbers in a computation problem and rely on what they know about structure, patterns, and properties of operations to mentally solve a problem. Dot images are similar to number talks, except the image used is an arrangement of dots that students might count in different ways. While participating in these activities, students need to be precise in their word choice and use of language (MP6).</p>

<p>This warm-up prompts students to interpret division of fractions in terms of the number of groups of one fraction in the other (i.e., “how many groups of this in that?” question). Students do not calculate the exact value of each expression. Instead, they decide if at least one group the size of the divisor is in the dividend. This requires students to use what they know about benchmark fractions and equivalent fractions to reason about the size of the numbers.</p>

<p>If students have trouble getting started, remind them that, in a previous lesson, one way they interpreted $4 \div \frac12 = {?}$ was as “how many $\frac12$s are in 4?” Ask them if that interpretation could apply here. Also encourage students to recall how the size of the divisor affects the quotient.</p>

<p>Some students may struggle with the last expression because they don’t easily see the relationship between fifths and eighths. Ask if they can think of a fraction, in eighths, that is close to $\frac35$, or a fraction in fifths that is close to $\frac78$. If not, ask them how they would reason about the expression if it was $2\frac68$ instead of $2\frac35$.</p>

<p>Ask students to share their reasoning after completing each problem and before they think about the next problem. Record and display their explanations for all to see.</p>

<p>Students may reason about the answers by thinking about the relative sizes of the two fractions, which is a valid approach. This shows an understanding of how the size of the dividend and that of the divisor affect the quotient.</p>

<p>To encourage students to connect the division expressions to multiplication, however, ask students to support their response to each of the first two problems with a related multiplication expression or equation, or in terms of equal-sized groups. For example, $\frac12\div\frac14$ could be connected to ${?} \boldcdot \frac14 = 2$, or the question “how many $\frac14$s are in $\frac12$?”.</p>

<p>What: Fans of <em>5 Practices for Orchestrating Productive Mathematical Discussions</em> (Smith and Stein, 2011) will recognize these as the 5 Practices. In this curriculum, much of the work of anticipating, sequencing, and connecting is handled by the materials in the activity narrative, launch, and synthesis sections. But teachers will need to take this ball and run with it by developing the capacity to prepare for and conduct whole-class discussions. The book itself would make excellent fodder for a teacher PLC or study group.</p>

<p>Where: Many classroom activities lend themselves to this structure.</p>

<p>Why: In a problem-based curriculum, many activities can be described as “do math and talk about it,” but the 5 Practices lend more structure to these activities so that they more reliably result in students making connections and learning new mathematics.</p>

<p>This activity prompts students to solve a problem involving division of fractions in a less-scaffolded way. Students can see two relevant numbers to work with, but they need to interpret the context, the visual information, and the written question to decide whether the missing value is the size of one group, the number of groups, or the given amount (MP1). By carefully making sense of the context, students see that part of a group is known and they have to find the size of the whole group.</p>

<p>As students work, monitor the strategies they use and the way they reason about the situation. Students may draw directly on the photo to make sense of the quantities. Some may draw a tape diagram or another type of diagram to represent the partially-filled water container. Others may bypass diagramming and instead reason verbally or by writing equations. Select a few students who use different but equally effective strategies to share later.</p>

<p>Arrange students in groups of 3–4. Show the short video. Ask students what questions we could ask about the amount of water in this situation that would require working with fractions to determine the answers.

<p>Possible questions:</p>

	<li>How much water is indicated by each tick mark of the water dispenser?</li>
	<li>How far would 1 liter of water fill the water dispenser?</li>
</ul>

<p>After hearing students’ ideas, give students 4–5 minutes of quiet work time and then another 2 minutes to share their responses with their group.

<p>Connect the reasoning done using the diagram to the mathematical operations. Regardless of the path students took, finding the amount of water that fills the entire dispenser requires dividing $\frac34$ liters by 2 (to find the amount in $\frac15$ of a dispenser), and then multiplying that amount by 5. Consider revisiting this activity later, after students have learned an algorithm for dividing a fraction, and using this problem to reinforce that multiplying by the denominator and dividing by the numerator makes sense as a way to divide by a fraction.</p>

<p>What: Students have quiet time to think about a problem and work on it individually, and then time to share their response or their progress with a partner. Once these partner conversations have taken place, some partnerships are selected to share their thoughts with the class.</p>

<p>Where: Classroom activities</p>

<p>Why: This is a teaching routine useful in many contexts whose purpose is to give all students enough time to think about a prompt and form a response before they are expected to try to verbalize their thinking. First they have an opportunity to share their thinking in a low-stakes way with one partner, so that when they share with the class they can feel calm and confident, as well as say something meaningful that might advance everyone’s understanding. Additionally, the teacher has an opportunity to eavesdrop on the partner conversations so that she can purposefully select students to share with the class.</p>

	<li>Answers vary. Possible answer: Lin poured $\frac{1}{3}$ liters of water into a bottle and it filled $\frac14$ of the bottle. How much water fits into the bottle?</li>
	<li>No answer is required.</li>
	<li>$4\boldcdot \frac13 = \frac43$, so $\frac43$ liters.

<p>Consider rearranging students into new groups of 4 so they can share their questions and solutions in small groups.</p>

<p>If possible, select one person who came up with a “$\frac 14$ of what number is $\frac 13$?” type of question, and another who wrote a “how many $\frac14$s in $\frac13?$” type of question to share their questions and explain their solution paths to the class. </p>

<p>If needed, use these examples to illustrate two different interpretations of the division statement.</p>

<ul>
	<li>First interpretation: If $\frac13$ liter fills $\frac14$ of a bottle, how many liters fill 1 bottle?</li>
	<li>Second interpretation: If 1 bottle contains $\frac14$ liter of water, how many bottles can be filled with $\frac 13$ liter of water?</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, students will likely find the first interpretation of division easier to represent and to solve using a diagram.</p>

<p>The diagram on the left shows the content of $\frac14$ of a bottle, which is $\frac 13$ liter, being multiplied by 4 to get the content of 1 bottle, which is $\frac 43$ liters. The diagram on the right shows that 1 bottle contains $\frac14$ liter, or 3 parts of $\frac {1}{12}$ liter. In $\frac13$ liter there are 4 parts of $\frac {1}{12}$, so $\frac13$ liter fills $1\frac13$ bottles.</p>

<p>In this lesson, we solved problems that involved finding the amount in one group. Present this problem and give students a minute of quiet think time: How long is a whole trip if $\frac23$ of a trip is $\frac45$ mile? Then, discuss some of the following questions.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>“What is the ‘one group’ we are interested in here?” (One full trip.)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>“Do we know the number of groups or the fraction of a group?” (Yes, $\frac23$ of a group.)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>“What multiplication equation and division equations can we write to represent this situation?” ($\frac23 \boldcdot {?} = \frac45$ and $\frac 45 \div \frac23 = {?}$)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>“How can we interpret $\frac23 \boldcdot {?} = \frac45$? in this context?” (We can think of it as asking “$\frac23$ of what distance is $\frac45$ mile?”)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>“How might we set up a tape diagram to help us answer the question?” (The tape should show two rectangles to represent $\frac23$ of a trip and $\frac45$ mile, which allows us to see $\frac13$ of the trip as $\frac25$ mile and the whole trip as $3 \boldcdot \frac25$ or $\frac65$ miles.)</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Explain to students that sometimes it is not always obvious whether a division situation involves finding the number of groups or the size of 1 group. There may be two 1 wholes to keep track of and two possible questions that could be asked. We need to analyze the situation carefully to reason correctly. </p>

Interpret and compute quotients of fractions, and solve word problems involving division of fractions by fractions, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations to represent the problem. <span class="clarification">For example, create a story context for $(2/3) \div (3/4)$ and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient; use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that $(2/3) \div (3/4) = 8/9$ because $3/4$ of $8/9$ is $2/3$. (In general, $(a/b) \div (c/d) = ad/bc$.) How much chocolate will each person get if 3 people share 1/2 lb of chocolate equally? How many 3/4-cup servings are in 2/3 of a cup of yogurt?

<p>Noah fills a soap dispenser from a big bottle that contains $2\frac13$ liters of liquid soap. That amount of soap will fill $3\frac12$ dispensers. How many liters of soap fit into one dispenser?</p>

<p>Use the diagram below to answer the question. Label all relevant parts of the diagram.</p>

<p>He can refill the dispenser $3\frac12$ times, which is $\frac72$ times. So each time, he uses $\frac23$ liters of soap.</p>
